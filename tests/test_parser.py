Wendell and Sherman Holmes, plus longtime friend Popsy Dixon made up the Holmes Brothers, a vocal group best known for putting their personal stamp on blues, gospel, country, pop and more. We revisit our conversation with the brothers about the transition from Christ Church, Virginia to New York and back again to home and family."
